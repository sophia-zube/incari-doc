# Project Outliner

## Overview

The **Project Outliner** contains a structured list of every **Scene** and **Screen** in a **Project**, and can be used to organize, manage, create, delete and edit them.

## Creating

New **Screens** and **Scenes** can be created by either:

* Right-clicking inside the **Project Outliner** and selecting `New`.
* Selecting `File` &gt; `New` from the **Menu**.
* Pressing `Ctrl` +`N` whilst the **Project Outliner** is active.

From here you can provide a descriptive name and select whether you wish to create a new **Screen** or a new **Scene**.

## Disabling Screens

When you **Start** the **Simulation** of a **Project** in **INCARI**, all **Screens** will initialize in separate windows. By disabling a **Scene** in the **Project Outliner**, you can prevent a **Screen** from being included in the **Simulation**.

To disable a **Screen**, simply click the eye \(👁\) icon.

## Unassigned Scenes

Unless a **Scene** is assigned to a **Screen**, it will appear under `Unassigned Scenes`, and will therefore be excluded from **Simulation**. When you create a **Scene** it is unassigned by default, unless a **Screen** was selected when it was created, in which case, it will be assigned to that **Screen**.

## Rearranging Scenes

**Scenes** can be rearranged easily by dragging and dropping them to a new place in the **Project Outliner**. Not only does this make it easier to organize **Scenes**, but you can also move a them to an entirely different **Screen**. or disable them entirely, by moving them into `Unassigned Scenes`.
