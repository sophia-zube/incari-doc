Disclaimer: 

It is not unheard of to sometimes have problems with high *GPU* usage when using **Incari Studio**. There are a couple of workarounds, one which requires access to the *Nvidia Control Panel*.

One can start off by clicking through `Global Preferences --> Viewport --> Enable VSync` and making sure it is toggled on. If this remedies the issue, the next steps are not necessary to investigate.

However, if the high *GPU* usage of **Incari Studio** has not been fixed, it is suggested to open up *Nvidia Control Panel*. It could be that the settings here are overriding those in **Incari Studio**, which
leads to high FPS (up to 500) and high GPU usage (up to 90%). 

The user can either set `Vertical Sync` (located under `Manage 3D Settings`) to `On` or `Use the 3D application setting`. This will result in the framerate be locked to the native display framerate; the GPU 
usage should drop to around ~20% for a small **Project**. Results may vary for large and robust **Projects**.
