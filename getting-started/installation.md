# Installation

At the moment **Incari** relies on the Windows SDK that comes with [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) (free version).
Therefore, the first step is to install the Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition (Desktop Development C++ setup), start it once, and create a profile.

For installation and licensing of **Incari Studio**, please follow these steps:

* Register in the **Incari** [website](https://www.incari.com/my-account/) and then activate your account from your e-mail.
