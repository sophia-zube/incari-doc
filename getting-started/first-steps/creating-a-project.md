# Creating a Project

## Project Manager

When first running **Incari Studio**, you will be met with the **Project Manager** window.

![](../.gitbook/assets/project-manager.png)

From here you can **Open**, **Run**, **Edit**, **Remove** and **Import** projects or create a **New Project**.

### Projects

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Open" %}
* Opens the currently selected project.
* You can also simply **double-click** the project's thumbnail to open a project.
* All previous projects will be available to access via the **Project Manager** so that you can quickly jump back in to your recent projects.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Run" %}

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Edit" %}
Allows you to edit the **Project**'s `Project Name`, `Project Location` and `Category`.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Remove" %}
Completely removes the selected **Project** from the **Project Manager** _and_ your local file system.

![WARNING: Deleting a project in the Project Manager will also delete all related files and assets from your hard drive.](../.gitbook/assets/deleteprojectwarning.png)
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Import" %}
Allows you to import a previously unopened **Project** from another location. This is useful for exchanging files between team members and opening templates.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### New Project

![](../.gitbook/assets/new-project.png)

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="General" %}
* `Project name` - A relevant title for your project. The name will also be used when creating the project's folder structure.
* `Project location` - The location that want to store your project in. By default, this will be the project path defined in **Preferences**.
* `Category` - Here you can choose from one of four categories; **Project**, **Template**, **Scene** or **Widget**. These help differentiate between full-blown projects and smaller-scale components. The category type is displayed on the project's thumbnail when you first open Incari.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Screen" %}
* `Name` - This is the identifying name given to the target **Screen**.
* `Resolution (px)` - This defines the _pixel_ resolution of the targeted display.
* `Dimensions (unit)` - This defines the dimensions of the screen in _3D units_.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Scene" %}
* `Name` - The name given to the initial scene, when the project is created. This will most likely be your root scene or main menu.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}
