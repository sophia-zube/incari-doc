# Incari Hub

**Incari Hub** serves as a central access point to all **Incari** products. It allows one to install the latest version of **Incari**, manage existing **Projects**, and obtain **Demo Projects**.

On the left-side Menu, there are several sections. We will go through each, one by one. Feel free to jump to the section you are most interested in:

## Projects

### My Projects

The _My Projects_ section allows the user to access, create, and manage their local **Projects**. Here there are two existing **Projects** called **'test'** and **'test2'**. The leftmost square with the plus icon is used to [create a new **Project**.](creating-a-project.md)

![My Projects.](../../.gitbook/assets/projectsmyprojects.png)

Each **Project** displays the username and **Incari Studio** version at the bottom. Clicking on the three dots that appear when hovering over a **Project** allows the user to open the **Project**, play the **Project** in **Incari Player**, show the **Project** in the user's local file library, and edit the **Project's** settings. It is also possible to delete the **Project** from here, either by removing it from the **Hub** or deleting it completely from the local disk.

### Remote Projects

The tab _Remote Projects_ gives access to **Demo Projects** that have been created by our very own **Incari** team. These can be downloaded with the small cloud icon at the bottom right. The **Project** will then appear under _My Projects_ and can be opened from there.

**Demo Projects** allow one to see how certain functionalities can be implemented in **Incari**. These range from a simple button to examples of the several methods of **Animation** available to the user. Discover more in the [**Demo Projects**](../../demo-projects/overview.md) documentation.

## Applications

### Incari Studio

Under _Incari Studio_, one can install different versions of **Incari Studio**. This can be done by locating a folder on your local machine, where **Incari Studio** is installed, or using the built-in installer. If there are no installations, a message will appear prompting the user to either `Locate` or `Install` a version of **Incari Studio**. Otherwise, the user can use the icon on the top right to do the same.

Note: Locating does not install **Incari Studio**. It simply points to where it is already existing on your computer after you have clicked through the file library that pops up.

Please note that if an existing **Project** was made with a previous version of **Incari Studio**, and this version is not currently installed within **Incari Hub**, you will be prompted to upgrade to the most recent version or locate the compatible version. Otherwise it will be impossible to open the **Project**.

## Community

### Documentation

The **Documentation** takes you straight to the instructional texts that teach the user the ins and outs of **Incari**, which you are at right now! It gives a run down of the basics, helps you get started, thoroughly explains each component of **Incari Studio**, and provides more information on a few **Demo Projects**. There's a lot to discover in the **Documentation**, written with care by the **Documentation** team.
