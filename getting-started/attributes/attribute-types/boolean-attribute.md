# Boolean Attributea

**Boolean Attributes** hold **Boolean Type Data**, and can either be _true_ or _false_. They are used to enable/disable certain characteristics and behaviour. They can be thought of as being like a light switch, which can turn a light on/off.

Simply click a **Boolean Attribute** to toggle between _true_ and _false_.
