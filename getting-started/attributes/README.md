# Attributes

Entities in **INCARI,** such as **Objects**, **Nodes**, **Screens** etc. have a collection of things called **Attributes**. An **Attribute** defines a specific characteristic of an entity, and thus by modifying the **Value** of these **Attributes** we can modify its characteristics.

Generally, **Attributes** fall in to one of two categories:

* **Object Attributes** - Modify the characteristics of **Objects** and can be edited in the **Attribute Editor**
* **Node Attributes** - Modify the behaviour and characteristics of **Nodes** and can be edited in the **Node Attribute Editor**.
