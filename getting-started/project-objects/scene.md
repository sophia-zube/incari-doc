# Scene

![](../../.gitbook/assets/iconscene.png)

A **Scene** is a collection of **Objects** that represent different unique places within your user interface, such as menus, maps and media players. Each **Scene** has its on 3D space, with the **Size** and **Resolution** being determined by the **Attributes** of the **Screen** that it is assigned to.

The **Scene Object** doesn't have any **Attributes** of its own, unlike every _other_ **Object** in **INCARI**.

There are a few **Nodes**, such as the [**KeyPress** **Node**](../../toolbox/events/keyboard/on-key-press.md), which require a **Scene Object** to be assigned as an **Attribute**. This can be done by dragging and dropping a **Scene** from the **Project Outliner** into the **Scene Attribute** of that **Node**.
