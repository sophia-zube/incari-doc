# Default Shadeless Model 

This model represents a material which displays a solid color and offers no response to light placement. It is rather simple, only allowing for selecting and editing:
 
* `Diffuse Color`, `Texture`, and `Blending`. 

All these **Attributes** are described in greater detail below.

## Attributes

### Material
![Material](../../.gitbook/assets/shadelessmodelmat1.png)

This **Attribute** provides the `Name` of the **Material** as well as the `Shading model` type. It also sets the `Alpha` value if it is toggled on. 

The `Alpha` channel is additional to the RGB channels and adds a kind of transparency to the object by mixing the background and foreground colors. For example, if the `Alpha` value is set to 0.5, then this would result in a 50% mix of the object and its background, providing a somewhat see-through quality. 


### Diffuse

`Color` of `Diffuse` sets the base diffuse color of the model. 

`Texture` takes any image to add any desired visual information. 

Using `Blending`, the `Texture` and `Color` are combined. If `Blending` is set to 1 then 100% of the `Texture` is displayed on the **Object**. If 0.5, then it displays a 50/50 ratio of `Texture` and `Color`. 

### Property Names

It is possible to hover over each **Attribute** and access their property names to be used in code or **Nodes**. A complete list of these names is as follows:

* `Use Alpha`: use_alpha
* `Alpha`: alpha
* `Color` (Diffuse): diffuse_color
* `Texture` (Diffuse): diffuse_map
* `Blending` (Diffuse): diffuse_map_blending
