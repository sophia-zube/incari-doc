# Events

Events are a way of triggering logic when a certain thing happens.

Many of **Incari**'s nodes have their own events, such as the **Project** node's **OnInitialize** event.

In addition, there are a few event nodes, which can trigger branches of logic along a pulse, when a certain user-defined event is met.
