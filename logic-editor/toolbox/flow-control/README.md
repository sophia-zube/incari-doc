# Flow Control

## Overview

Flow Control \(or Control Flow\) defines the order in which logic is evaluated, allows a program to consider multiple conditions and performs different actions based on those variable conditions.

Nodes in the Control Flow category fall into several subcategories.

### Relational Expression Nodes

Relational expression nodes compare two values and yield a [**Boolean** ](../../data-types/bool.md)value based on the relationship of those inputs. These include the following:

* **IsEqual**
* **IsGreaterEqual**
* **IsLessEqual**

### Logical Operator Nodes

Logical operator nodes combine [**Boolean** ](../../data-types/bool.md)expressions to yield a [**Boolean**](../../data-types/bool.md) value based on the outcome of multiple conditions and their logical relationship to one another. These are:

* **AND**
* **OR**
* **Negate**

### Pulse Flow Nodes

Pulse flow nodes are used to better visually organise the Node Editor graph, and to implement control flow along multiple paths depending on provided conditions or combinations of conditions. They are:

* **Branch**
* **Switch**
* **Sequential**
* **Toggle**
