# Pulse Flow Nodes

Pulse flow nodes, when combined with

Branching is used to implement control flow along multiple different paths depending on the evaluation of certain conditions.

The **Branch** _node_ takes a single [**Boolean** ](../../../data-types/bool.md)value as an input and directs the flow of logic along one of two [**Pulses**](./), depending on whether the input value is _true_ or _false._

By using a combination of _relational_ nodes \([**IsEqual**](./), [**IsGreaterEqual**](./) and [**IsLessEqual**](./)\), Pulse flow nodes,
