# Creating a Blank Function

Another way of adding **Nodes** to our **Logic Graph** is by right-clicking anywhere on the graph and begin typing the name of our **Node**. Once we see the **Node** we need, we can drag and drop it onto our graph. We will be using a **Function Node** here and what is unique about this particular **Node** is that we can double-click it, to open a separate **Node Graph**, which acts like a folder, containing its own set of logic.

{% hint style="info" %}
* Add a **Function Node**.
* Double-click it to open its own **Logic Graph**.
{% endhint %}
