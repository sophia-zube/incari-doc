# What is a Function?

Now that you have built a couple of **Logic Trees**, we are going to introduce the concept of **Functions**. **Functions** are a way of taking a _single-purpose_ set of instructions and encapsulating them in your own custom [**Node**](../../getting-started/interface/managers-editors-and-outliners/logic-editor.md#nodes), to be reused throughout your project.

Like [**Nodes**](../../getting-started/interface/managers-editors-and-outliners/logic-editor.md#nodes), **Functions**, to the outside world, have **Inputs** and/or **Outputs**, but where the function of INCARI's [**Nodes**](../../getting-started/interface/managers-editors-and-outliners/logic-editor.md#nodes) **\*\*are** _**pre-defined**_**,** Functions **are** _**user-defined**_**. This means that we can define our own \[**Pulse **\]\(../../getting-started/interface/managers-editors-and-outliners/logic-editor.md\#pulse\)and \[**Data**\]\(../../getting-started/interface/managers-editors-and-outliners/logic-editor.md\#data\) \[**Sockets**\]\(../../getting-started/interface/managers-editors-and-outliners/logic-editor.md\#sockets\), as well as the internal logic used in the evaluation** Function\*\*. This is useful because it allows us to:

1. _Reuse_, rather than _duplicate_, our logic.
2. _Organise_ our logic into succinct, self-contained "machines".
3. Make our [**Node Graph**](../../getting-started/interface/managers-editors-and-outliners/logic-editor.md#5-the-logic-graph-node-graph) much more _tidy_ and easy to navigate.
