## Introduction

This section describes the first steps to start using **Incari Studio** and gives an overview of its main components and some basic concepts that will be useful in this training.

### Getting Started

The first step to get started with **Incari** is installation and licensing. For this, follow these steps:

* Register in the **Incari** [website](https://www.incari.com/my-account/) and then activate your account from your e-mail.

![Registration page in incari.com](../.gitbook/assets/website-register.png)

* After activating your account, log-in and go to Downloads. Here you can download **Incari Hub**.

![Account dashboard in incari.com](../.gitbook/assets/website-dashboard.png)

* Install and then start **Incari Hub**. 

![The Incari Hub welcome screen.](../.gitbook/assets/incar-hub-login.png)

* Log-in into **Incari Hub** with your **Incari** credentials.

* In **Incari Hub**, go to the **Incari Studio** tab, under _Applications_. Here you can manage your installed versions of **Incari Studio** and install new ones.

![](../.gitbook/assets/incari-install1.png)

* Press on "Install New". Then you will see the available versions of **Incari Studio** to install.

![](../.gitbook/assets/incari-install2.png)

* To install **Incari Studio** 2021.4, press on the plus \(+\) sign and the download will start.

* After the download is finished, the install window for **Incari Studio** 2021.4 will open. Click "Next" to proceed and go through the installation process.

![The Incari Studio welcome screen.](../.gitbook/assets/incaristudio20214_installer.png)

*  Go to the **Incari** [website](https://www.incari.com/my-account/), where you can manage your subscriptions and obtain the license key.

* Use the license key to activate your subscription in **Incari Hub**.

![The Incari Hub license screen.](../.gitbook/assets/incari-hub-license2.png)


At the moment **Incari** relies on the Windows SDK that comes with [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) (free version).
So the user also needs to install the Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition (Desktop Development C++ setup), start it once and create a profile.

### Incari Hub

**Incari Hub** serves as a central access point to all **Incari** products. It allows to install the latest version of **Incari**, manage your **Projects**, and obtain **Demo Projects**.

On the left-side Menu, there are two sections: *Projects* and *Applications*.

Under *Projects*, the tab *My Projects* allows the user to access, create, and manage their local **Projects**. The tab *Remote Projects* gives access to **Demo Projects** created by the **Incari** team, these can be downloaded and then opened locally. **Demo Projects** are useful to see how certain functionalities can be implemented in **Incari**.

![](../.gitbook/assets/incari-hub-myprojects.png)

![](../.gitbook/assets/incari-hub-remoteprojects.png)

![](../.gitbook/assets/incari-hub-remoteprojectslist.png)

Under *Applications*, **Incari Applications** can be accessed and managed. For each **Application**, it is possible to get the latest version, install it, and check for updates.

![](../.gitbook/assets/incari-hub-applications.png)

As seen in the previous section, **Incari Hub** also allows to manage the license and user account.

### Incari Studio

**Incari Studio** is an all-in-one tool for the streamlined work of HMI (Human-Machine Interface) creation. It allows for quick UI (User Interface) prototyping and deployment.

![](../.gitbook/assets/incari-studio-initial.png)

In the usual case, there is a separation between design and development. On one side, developers have to implement the entire interface from source code, and then spend a lot of time reviewing results, adjusting animations, requesting new assets, and iterating the entire process. On the other side, designers may not be aware of software limitations such as animation types or others. With **Incari**, all necessary tools for building UI are available from the beginning. Designers can focus on the interface layout or the creation of animation while developers work on the logic and providing data sources, then both parts can be easily connected thus implementing the entire UI.

The main features of **Incari Studio** are:

   * It is easy to import and use designs from tools such as _Sketch_, _Figma_ or _Photoshop_.
   * The **Animation Editor** incorporated in **Incari** allows to create advanced animations of UI elements.
   * Features implementation can be easily reused, thus speeding up **Project** production.
   * It supports any input source, be it haptic, auditory, visual, or external from CAN, MQTT, HTTP.

![](../.gitbook/assets/incari-studio-end.png)

### Incari Player

**Incari Player** is the component that displays **Projects** created in **Incari Studio**. It runs as a stand-alone application in which **Incari** **Projects** can be loaded and played.

It can receive external communication from sources such as HTTP, Bluetooth, CAN bus, MQTT, NAV.

**Incari Player** is focused on performance and stability. For example, it does not waste GPU time in calculating elements that are not visible for the user. 

It supports multiple screens and out-of-the-box data synchronization between scenes, thus making it easy to have synchronized multi-screen animations or interaction between elements in differents screens.


### User Interface Overview

For a quick overview of the general interface in **Incari Studio**, we will use one of the **Demo Projects**.

First, we have to download it from the *Remote Projects* tab in **Incari Hub**, and then we can load it from the *My Projects* tab.

We choose the `methodsofanimation` **Project**. In the *Remote Projects* tab, we find it and click on the cloud to download it.

![](../.gitbook/assets/incari-hub-animationmethodschoice.png)

Then, the **Project** should appear in the *My Projects* tab, where we can load it by clicking on the play button that appears when we hover over the **Project**.

![](../.gitbook/assets/incari-hub-animationmethodsmyproj.png)

Now with the **Demo Project** loaded we can have a quick overview of the interface.

![](../.gitbook/assets/animationmethods-project.png)

The components of the interface in **Incari** are called **Modules**. Each one has a different purpose, in the next section we give an overview of their functionalities. **Modules** can be either visible or hidden. Choosing which ones are visible can be done by right-clicking the top bar and selecting or deselecting them. Moreover, **Modules** can also made visible from the `View` menu in the top bar and they can be hidden by clicking the `X` at the top right of each of them.

![](../.gitbook/assets/modulesmenu.png)

![](../.gitbook/assets/modulesviewmenu.png)

These **Modules** can be docked in the **Incari Studio** interface as the user prefers, thus allowing for a complete customization of the positions and sizes of the visible **Modules**. 

![](../.gitbook/assets/dockingmodules1.gif)

Moreover, **Modules** can be docked together and then accessed via the tabs that are automatically created.

![](../.gitbook/assets/dockingmodules2.gif)

**Modules** can be also used as independent windows, which can be very useful when working with more than one screen.

![](../.gitbook/assets/moduleindep.gif)

**Modules** that are individual windows can be locked so they do not dock on the main **Incari Studio** interface. This is done by clicking on the lock icon that appears on the top-right of a module that is being seen as an independent window.

![](../.gitbook/assets/dockingenable.png)


The **Viewport** shows what will be displayed when the **Project** is run and its look can be customized. For this, go to `Edit > Global Preferences > Viewport`.

![](../.gitbook/assets/viewport2.png)

![](../.gitbook/assets/viewport.png)


### Project Creation

Creating a new **Project** can be done in **Incari Hub**. Under the tab *My Projects*, press on the big plus sign.

![](../.gitbook/assets/create-projects.png)

Then, the name, location and **Incari Studio** version of the **Project** can be chosen and the size for the default **Scene** and **Screen** set.

![](.././gitbook/assets/create-projects2.png)

After clicking on `Create`, the new empty **Project** is created and we can start working on it.

![](../.gitbook/assets/empty-project.png)

### Basic Concepts

To finalize this introductory section, we shall review a few basic concepts that will prove to be useful in this first approach to **Incari Studio**.

* **Screen** and **Scene**

  - **Screen**: The **Screen Object** in **Incari** contains the technical specifications of the physical display that the **Project** will ultimately be displayed on.
  - **Scene**: A collection of **Objects** that represent different unique places within your *User Interface*, such as Menus, maps and media players. Each **Scene** has its own _3D_ space, with the **Size** and **Resolution** being determined by the **Attributes** of the **Screen** that it is assigned to.

* Coordinate system
  
  A coordinate system is a system that uses numbers to uniquely determined the position of points in space. In the case of **Incari** it is used to determine the position of **Objects** in a **Scene**.

  **Incari** uses cartesian coordinates in *2D* and *3D*, this means that the position is determined by the distance along 2 or 3 axes from an arbitrary point that is the origin. The unit used in *2D* for these distances is pixels (px). Let us take a look at the two cases (*2D* and *3D*) separately.

  We start with the simpler *2D* case. To illustrate this, let us use an example of two squares, one red and one black, positioned over a white background.

  ![](../.gitbook/assets/2d-positioning.png)

  The position of these squares is determined by two numbers, the x-coordinate and the y-coordinate. These two numbers are the distances along the X and Y-axes, respectively, in pixels. For each object, these are set in the **Transformation Attributes**.

  The red square is positioned in `(250, 300)`, which means that its top-left corner is 250 pixels away from the origin along the X-axis and 300 pixels away along the Y-axis.

  ![](../.gitbook/assets/2d-coordinate.png)

  The black square position is `(10, 10)`.

  ![](../.gitbook/assets/2d-positionblack.png)

  One case that is worth looking into before moving onto *3D* is that of **Groups**. In the case of **Groups**, the position of the **Objects** in the **Group** is relative to the position of the **Group** and not that of the origin. For this to be clearer, let us continue using our example of the two squares.

  In *3D*...
  
* Visual programming

   Traditional programming languages are text-based. This means that programs are written as lines of code, with the use of a particular syntax, functions, declaration of variables, etc. Opposed to this, there is visual programming, which is the approach used in **Incari**. In visual programming, 

   Pulses and nodes...


## Modules

There are several **Modules** that subset the available functionality within **Incari**. These **Modules** provide tools and organizational abilities to the user. 
### Project Outliner

The **Project Outliner** contains a structured list of every **Scene** and **Screen** in a **Project** and can be used to organize, manage, create, and delete them. It is located in the bottom left corner on start.

![](../.gitbook/assets/projectoutlinerlocation.png)

Adding a **Screen** is simple.

![](../.gitbook/assets/projectoutlineraddscreen.png)

The user can either:
* Click on the plus, then click the `Screen` button (shown in the image above).
* Or right-click inside the **Project Outliner** and select `Create` &gt; `Screen` from the pop-up.
* Or select `File` &gt; `New Screen` from the drop-down **Menu**.
* Or pressing `Ctrl`+`N` while the **Project Outliner** is active.

The user can customize the **Screen** in the **Attribute Editor** (which will be covered soon). For now, it's enough to know that it is possibel to alter the screen in terms of `Transformation`, `Camera`, `Background Color`, and more. 

![](../.gitbook/assets/projectoutlinercustomizingscreen2.png)

Adding a **Scene** is the same, except `Scene` is selected instead of `Screen`.

![](../.gitbook/assets/projectoutlineraddscene.png)

It is possible to move a **Scene** from one **Screen** to another by clicking and dragging. 

![](../.gitbook/assets/projectoutlinermovingscenes.gif)

Unless a **Scene** is assigned to a **Screen**, it will appear under `Unassigned Scenes` and will be excluded from the **Simulation**. When a **Scene** is created it is unassigned by default -- unless a **Screen** was selected when it was created, then it will be assigned to that **Screen**.

![](../.gitbook/assets/projectoutlinerunassignedscene.png)

Playing a **Screen** requires selecting a root **Scene**, if there is more than one. The user can play two **Screens** at once and two **Players** will show on the computer screen. The image below gives an example of this and the red boxes enclose the respective root **Scenes**, which are the **Scenes** that are displayed. 

![](../.gitbook/assets/projectoutlinerplayingtwoscreens.png)

### Asset Manager

This is the place where all project **Assets** are managed. **Assets** are the files in the **Project Asset** folder. The user can organize resources into folders, search for **Assets** by name,
 or use a view filter to display only specific types of **Objects**.

It is also a place where the user can create new **Assets** like Animations, ImageSequences, Materials, Models, and a couple of others. 

When the user wishes to use **Assets** in a **Project** they have to drag and drop them into a **Scene**, which will add that **Asset** to **Scene Outliner**. 


**Assets** can be imported by clicking on the plus ![](../.gitbook/assets/plusIcon%20%284%29%20%284%29%20%284%29%20%284%29%20%284%29%20%284%29%20%284%29%20%284%29%20%288%29.PNG) icon at the 
top left of the **Asset Manager**, selecting `Import Assets`, and finding the files to import to the **Asset Manager**.

![](../.gitbook/assets/import-asset.png)

For creating an **Asset**, right-click on the **Asset Manager**, select `Create Asset`, and choose which kind of **Asset** to create.
 ![](../.gitbook/assets/create-asset.png)

**Assets** can be deleted in the following ways:

* Right-click the **Asset** and select the `Delete` button from the pop-up.
* Select an **Asset** and press `del`.

![](../.gitbook/assets/asset-delete.png)


**Assets** can be renamed by right-clicking an item and selecting `Rename`. You can then type a new name and press **`⏎`**/`Return` to confirm the change.

![](../.gitbook/assets/asset-rename.png)


The **Asset Manager** offers different views of the files in the **Assets** folder. The general view can be switched on the top left between flat 
and folder tree view and the files can be seen as either icons or in a list, which is chosen in the bottom right corner.

![](../.gitbook/assets/assetmanagericons.png)
![](../.gitbook/assets/assetmanagerlist.png)


### Scene Outliner

The **Scene Outliner** contains the list of **Assets** related to the current **Scene**. It is used to organize **Assets** within a **Scene**, create new **Assets** or delete them. 

It is possible to group **Assets** by clicking the plus and locating `Groups` or right-clicking in the **Scene Outliner** and selecting `Groups`. 

![](../.gitbook/assets/sceneoutlinercreategroup.png)

The user can customize a **Group** by renaming it, duplicating it, copying and pasting, and more. 

**Incari** offers several types of **Objects** for the user to add in a **Scene** by way of the **Scene Outliner**. These are:

* **Vectors** (in both 2D and 3D),

![](../.gitbook/assets/sceneoutlinervector3dand2d.png)

* **Camera** (seen in the above image under the **Vector2D** category),


* three-dimensional objects called **Primitives**,

![](../.gitbook/assets/sceneoutlinerprimitives.png)


* **Lights**,

![](../.gitbook/assets/sceneoutlinerlights.png)


* **3D** and **2D** **Objects**, 

![](../.gitbook/assets/sceneoutliner3dand2dobjects.png)


* and **Mesh**. 


This gives a general idea of the extensive library of objects that can be placed in an **Incari Scene**. 

### Attribute Editor 

To open the **Attribute Editor**, right-click on the Menu bar in **Incari** and click on **Attribute Editor** from the drop-down list. This can be seen in the illustration below:

![](../.gitbook/assets/attribute-editor.PNG)

The **Attribute Editor** is responsible for changing properties of a selected **Object**. For example, when a **Rectangle** is selected, the user can change its **Position**, **Rotation**, **Size**,  **Color**, and more, within the **Scene**.  
Depending on the type of **Object**, properties may vary. However basic ones, like `Transformation`, `Opacity`, and `Name`, remain the same among all **Objects**. 
All property changes have an immediate effect in the preview window, allowing the user to quickly visualize the changes made.

An example of the usefuleness of the **Attribute Editor**:

![](../.gitbook/assets/attributeeditorexample.png)

Here, the categories of possible properties are highlighted with red boxes. The user can change the **Cube's** `Position`, `Rotation`, `Scale`, `Position` of the `Rotation Pivot`, `Axis Division` of the **Cube**, toggle `Normals` on and off, and select a **Material** by either dragging and dropping, or searching within the pop-up upon clicking. 

### Image Sequence Editor

The **Image** **Sequence** **Editor** allows the user to create and edit **Image** **Sequences**, which have the extension `.incseq` in the **Asset** **Manager**. 

It’s a flexible tool to create custom animations depending on the specific  needs of the project. For example, it can be used to create two-state icons with on/off states or even highly complex **Image** **Sequences** that are made up hundreds of frames! Later, the user can easily manipulate the **Image Sequence** animation from the **Logic** **Editor** by adjusting time and speed, choosing the start and end frame to be played, and so on.

Once an **Image Sequence** is open in the **Image Sequence Editor**, images can be added or removed from the sequence and their order can be changed.

The top panel gives the options to save or clear the **Image Sequence**.

![](../.gitbook/assets/image-seq-editor.png)

To add an image to the **Image Sequence**, drag it from the **Asset Manager**.

![](../.gitbook/assets/image-seq-add.gif)

Additionally, to remove an image from the sequence, select it and either right-click it and choose `delete` or press `del`. To move an image within the sequence, drag it and drop it in the desired position.


###  Animation Editor


The **Animation Editor** is used for creating and editing **Keyframe**-based timeline animations, which have the file extension `.incani`. It can either be opened from the `View` drop-down Menu on the top panel of **Incari**, or by right-clicking on the Menu bar in **Incari** and clicking on **Animation Editor** from the drop-down list, or simply by double-clicking an **Animation** **Asset** in the **Asset Manager**. 

![](../.gitbook/assets/animation-editor2.png)

It's easy to create new **Animations** and then drag and drop scene elements to Animation Editor inside of the Animation Editor. 
The user can choose the property to animate, alter its length, and play with **Animation** Bézier curves. The main window, which contains all the options to create and edit an **Animation**, is shown below.
