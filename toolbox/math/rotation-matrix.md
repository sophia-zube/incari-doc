# Rotation Matrix

## Overview

![The Rotation Matrix Node.](../../.gitbook/assets/node-rotation-matrix2.png)

The **Rotation Matrix** **Node** receives three angles as inputs and generates a **Matrix4x4** that represents a _rotation_ along the X, Y, and Z axes in the received angles.

## Attributes

### Inputs

| Attribute | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `Default Angle X` | **Float** | The angle, in degrees, along the X axis in which the _rotation_ will be performed, if no value is provided in the `Angle X in degree` **Socket**. |
| `Default Angle Y` | **Float** | The angle, in degrees, along the Y axis in which the _rotation_ will be performed, if no value is provided in the `Angle Y in degree` **Socket**. |
| `Default Angle Z` | **Float** | The angle, in degrees, along the Z axis in which the _rotation_ will be performed, if no value is provided in the `Angle Z in degree` **Socket**. |

## Inputs

| Input | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| _Pulse Input_ \(►\) | **Pulse** | A standard **Input Pulse**, to trigger the execution of the **Node**. |
| `Angle X in degree` | **Float** | The angle, in degrees, along the X axis in which the _rotation_ will be performed. |
| `Angle Y in degree` | **Float** | The angle, in degrees, along the Y axis in which the _rotation_ will be performed. |
| `Angle Z in degree` | **Float** | The angle, in degrees, along the Z axis in which the _rotation_ will be performed. |

## Outputs

| Output | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| _Pulse Output_ \(►\) | **Pulse** | A standard **Output Pulse**, to move onto the next **Node** along the **Logic Branch**, once this **Node** has finished its execution. |
| `Rotation Matrix` | **Matrix4x4** | A **Matrix4x4** representing _rotations_ along the X, Y, and Z axes in the given angles. |
