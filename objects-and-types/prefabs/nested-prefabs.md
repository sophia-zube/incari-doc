# Nested Prefabs

It is possible to include **Prefab Instances** within other **Prefabs**. These are called **Nested Prefabs**. This section shows how to create them.

There are two ways to create a **Nested Prefab**. One is creating a new **Prefab** within a **Prefab** and the other one is using an existing **Prefab**. Both are shown below.

## Using a New Prefab

To create a **Nested Prefab** using a new **Prefab**, go to the **Prefab View** of the **Prefab** in which you wish to include another **Prefab**. Then select the **Objects** that will compose the **Nested Prefab**, right-click and click on `Make prefab`. Then, save the **Prefab** and the change will take effect on all of its **Instances**. Additionally, the newly created **Prefab** will generate its **Prefab Asset** and can also be used as any other **Prefab**.

## Using an existing Prefab

To create a **Nested Prefab** using an existing **Prefab**, go to the **Prefab View** of the intended parent **Prefab**. Then, select the intended child **Prefab(s)** from the **Asset Manager** and drag it to either the **Viewport** or the **Scene Outliner**. Finally, save the **Prefab** and the change will take effect on all of its **Instances**.
