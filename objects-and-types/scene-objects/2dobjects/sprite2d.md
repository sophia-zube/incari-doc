# Sprite2D

The **Sprite2D Object**, located under the **2D** section of the **Scene Outliner**, is an **Object** which acts as a canvas for an image **Asset** to be displayed on.


As **Sprite2D** also shares some of its **Attributes** with other **Objects**, it is discussed in detail in the [**Sprite Attributes**](../../attributes/common-attributes/sprite.md) page of the [**Common Attributes**](../../attributes/common-attributes/) section.

However, the most important **Attribute** is the `Diffuse Texture` under `Sprite`. Here the user can add a new image to the **Sprite2D**. 

![Sprite Object before Asset is Selected.](../../../.gitbook/assets/sprite2dbefore.png)

Locate `Diffuse Texture` as shown above and select an **Asset** from the pop-up Menu.

![Sprite Object after Asset is Selected.](../../../.gitbook/assets/sprite2dafter.png)

Once selected, the **Asset** is displayed through the **Sprite2D**.
