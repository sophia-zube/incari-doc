# Image Sequence Sprite

The **Image Sequence Sprite**, located under the **3D** section of the **Scene Outliner**, creates a *sprite* that acts like a canvas for an **Image Sequence Asset** to be displayed on. 

While the **Image Sequence Sprite** has several **Attributes** that alter its visual aspects, the most important is the `Diffuse Texture` under `Sprite`. Here the user can create a new **Image Sequence** or locate an already created one. 

There are several **Nodes** that are attributed to **Image Sequences**. More information can be found [here](../../../toolbox/incari/imagesequence/README.md) and [here.](../../../toolbox/events/imagesequence/README.md)
