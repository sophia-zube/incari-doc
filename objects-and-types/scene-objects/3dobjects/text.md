# Text

The **Text Object** is a very versatile feature of **Incari Studio**. 

## Value

`Value` defines the text that will appear in the **Text Object**. This can be any sequence of characters that the font supports, including special characters such as emojis ðŸ˜‰.

{% hint style="info" %}
Additionally, the `Value` **Attribute** can be used to add extra styling in the form of HTML/CSS. This is achieved using `<span>` tags and is only recommended to users who are familiar with these languages.
{% endhint %}

```markup
Without CSS
<br>
<span style="
    font-style: italic;font-weight:bold;
    background:linear-gradient(#FEE140 0%, #FA709A 100%);
    -webkit-background-clip:text;-webkit-text-fill-color:transparent;">

    With CSS
</span>
```

## Size and Resolution

Although you may already be familiar with the `Size` and `Resolution` **Attributes** of the **Camera Object**, things work slightly differently with **Text** and **Web Sprite Objects**.

With **Camera**, `Resolution` relates to the resolution of a _physical_ piece of hardware ,i.e., a display. With **Text** and **Web Sprite**, however, both `Size` and `Resolution` relate to something which exists in _virtual_ 3D space. So although, like **Camera**, the `Size` **Attribute** defines the **Object's** size in 3D space, the `Resolution` **Attribute** defines the resolution of the content that will be stretched to fit that space.

## Font Family

`Font Family` allows one to select a generic font family \(`Manrope` or  `Source Code Pro`\) or a custom font that has been added in [**Project Settings**](../../../modules/project-settings/fonts.md).

**Text Objects** are capable of handling [*variable fonts*](../../../modules/project-settings/fonts.md#variable-fonts) and let the user configure certain aspects, called `Parameters`. The *gif* below demonstrates what a font looks like with no `Parameters` in its **Attributes** and what it looks like when the user switches to a font that does.

## Alignment

Alignment works like any other word processor. You can align your text to be left-aligned, centre-aligned or right-aligned, using the `left`, `center`and `right`options respectively.

## Font Size

`Font Size` defines the approximate height, in pixels, from the _lowest descent_ to the _highest ascent_ of a font.

## Font Color / Background Color

**Colors** can be set in various ways in **Incari** and work very much like they do in other software. You can manually adjust the **HSB** / **RGBA** values or input a **Hex Code**, using their corresponding [**Color Attribute**](../../attributes/attribute-types/color-attribute.md).

## Sprite

Additionally, **Text** also shares **Common Attributes** of the **Sprite** category; which are:

* `Alpha`
* `Flip U` and `Flip V`
* `Sort Index`

There are also several **Nodes** attributed to **Text Objects**. More information can be found [here](../../../toolbox/incari/object/set-text.md), [here](../../../toolbox/incari/object/get-text-color.md) and [here.](../../../toolbox/incari/object/set-text-color.md)

## Translation

It is also possible to switch to `Translation` by clicking the 
right-most icon of the `Text` **Attribute**.

This lets the user access the `.local` file provided in the [**Project Settings**](../../../modules/project-settings/localization.md). The keys will appear as options in the `Translation` dropdown. The translation of the current language will be used. This is set in the **Project Settings** but can be altered with the [**Localization Nodes**](../../../toolbox/localization/README.md).
